The website mockup contains the website home page and the app access page which is also navigable from the website (and not just from the app). In the web mockup you find the home, the login and the main pages, everything else must be the same as the path of the mobile app. Obviously I have not redone all the pages also for the web since you already have all the perfect path in the app mockup. However, you can find some graphic material worked by the designer of the customer, which may be useful for you. REMEMBER THAT GRAPHIC FILES may be different from the app mockup path (because older as there may ne updates not applied to yet). ALWAYS FOLLOW  EXCLUSIVELY THE PATH OF APP MOCKUP in order to make the web path (that must be the same). Thanks
